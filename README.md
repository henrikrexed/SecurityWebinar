# Kubernetes Security

This repository contains the files used for the demo delivered during the webinar  Kubernetes Security Essentials: Protecting Your Clusters from Threats
<p align="left "><img src="/image/redhat.png" width="20%" alt="tetragon Logo" /></p>

this repository will use solutions to measure the usage of those agents, we will rely on: 
* the OpenTelemetry Demo
* ungard application
* Goat application to generate security vioalation
* Hipster-shop

* All the observability data generated by the environment would be sent to Dynatrace.

## Prerequisite
The following tools need to be install on your machine :
- jq
- kubectl
- git
- Helm
- oc (needs to be installed and configured)
- 
to run this environment you will need an OpenShift Cluster with RHACS Operator


### 1. Clone Github repo
```shell
NAME=dynatrace-redhat-security
```
```shell
git clone  https://github.com/henrikrexed/SecurityWebinar
cd SecurityWebinar
```



## Getting started


### Dynatrace Tenant
#### 1. Dynatrace Tenant - start a trial
If you don't have any Dynatrace tenant , then I suggest to create a trial using the following link : [Dynatrace Trial](https://dt-url.net/observable-trial)
Once you have your Tenant save the Dynatrace tenant url in the variable `DT_TENANT_URL` (for example : https://dedededfrf.live.dynatrace.com)
```
DT_TENANT_URL=<YOUR TENANT Host>
```

##### 2. Create the Dynatrace API Tokens
The dynatrace operator will require to have several tokens:
* Token to deploy and configure the various components
* Token to ingest metrics and Traces


###### Operator Token
One for the operator having the following scope:
* Create ActiveGate tokens
* Read entities
* Read Settings
* Write Settings
* Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
* Read configuration
* Write configuration
* Paas integration - installer downloader
<p align="center"><img src="/image/operator_token.png" width="40%" alt="operator token" /></p>

Save the value of the token . We will use it later to store in a k8S secret
```shell
API_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN VALUE>
```
###### Ingest data token
Create a Dynatrace token with the following scope:
* Ingest metrics (metrics.ingest)
* Ingest logs (logs.ingest)
* Ingest events (events.ingest)
* Ingest OpenTelemetry
* Read metrics
<p align="center"><img src="/image/data_ingest_token.png" width="40%" alt="data token" /></p>
Save the value of the token . We will use it later to store in a k8S secret

```shell
DATA_INGEST_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN VALUE>
```

### Deploy most of the components 
The application will deploy the entire environment:
```shell
chmod 777 deployment.sh
./deployment.sh  --clustername "${NAME}" --dturl "${DT_TENANT_URL}" --dtingesttoken "${DATA_INGEST_TOKEN}" --dtoperatortoken "${API_TOKEN}" 
```
